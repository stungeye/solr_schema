=========================

It looks as though Blacklight can still handle only MARC (binary and XML) natively. If this is the case, best practice seems to be to write wrapper scripts which will convert MODS/DC, etc, into solr XML records. There's already a Blacklight test data repository, and this is the repository for the data scripts.
